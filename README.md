# Starter for deploying [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) models on [Render](https://render.com)

This repo can be used as a starting point to deploy [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) models on Render.

The sample app described here is up at https://fastai-v3.onrender.com. Test it out with bear images!

You can test your changes locally by installing Docker and using the following command:

```
docker build -t cnr-cable-problem-ml-model . && docker run --rm -it -p 55563:55563 -p 55564:55564 cnr-cable-problem-ml-model
```

The guide for production deployment to Render is at https://course.fast.ai/deployment_render.html.
